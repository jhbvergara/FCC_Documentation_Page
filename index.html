                    JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

                    JavaScript was first known as <strong>Livescript</strong>, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name <strong>LiveScript</strong>. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

                    Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the <strong>var</strong> keyword as follows.
                </p>
                <code>
                    var money; <br>
                    var name;
                </code>

                    While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of a given set of paths. In such cases, you need to use conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the <strong>if..else</strong> statement.
                </p>
                <code>
                    var age = 20; <br>
         
                    if( age > 18 ) { <br>
                    document.write("<b>Qualifies for driving</b>"); <br>
                    }

                    <h2>Data Types</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

                <p>
                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                    while (condition) statement
                </code>
                
                <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: <br>
                    The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                </p>
                <code>
                    var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
                </code>

            <section id="function_declarations" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h2>Function Declarations</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function,. enclosed in parentheses and seperated by commas.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function named square:</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function square(number) { return number * number; }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>
                    return number * number;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
